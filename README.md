To obtain the data file to use this IMDB database program:
1. Use this link to download the IMDB "basics" data file. https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.basics.tsv.gz
2. Extract the file to the same folder as the other project files (the extracted file should be called "data.tsv." If it is not, rename it, as the program expects this file name to load the database.
3. At this point, you can make the executable and run the program.
